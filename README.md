##Task Manager with Web Socket

Simple task manager list. This allows you to add tasks to a list as well as delete and complete them, hopefully help users stay
organized. It uses websockets to keep lists the same on different browser windows.

Start by `npm i` and then in a new terminal navigate down to the `server` folder and also `npm i` there.

Use `npm start` in the root directory to start the frontend and then in the other, server folder, terminal
run `node server.js` to start the backend.
